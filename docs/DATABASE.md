# Database Documentation

## Overview

No database is present or configured in the "Kotlin Gradle Project". The codebase does not include any database-related dependencies, schema definitions, ORM configurations (e.g., Exposed, Hibernate, Room), migration tools (e.g., Flyway, Liquibase), or data access layers. All database-related sections are skipped as nothing exists in the code to document. 

If a database is added in the future, this document should be updated accordingly.
